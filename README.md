# Couette Flow: limitations of the linearized Boltzmann equation
Project for **Statistical Mechanics**

For the **Couette** flow, it is possible to compute analytically the solution of the **Bolzmann equation**.

To simplify it, hypothesis are made to linearize the equation, the **Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook** (BGK) operator is 
introduced, and the molecular riemmision at walls is modelled as **pure diffusion** to simplify gas-surface interactions.

To asses the limits of the semplifications introduced, the given software has been used to perfom **Direct Monte Carlo** 
simulations.
